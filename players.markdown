# The Players

## Juni Kim

A wannabe concealer, Juni Kim always attempts to hide the amount of pi or gwang
that he possesses in a futile bid to force Sangmok or Tei to call "go". He grins
when he has a poktan, and his antics are frequently protested by Tei Kim.

He usually leads on the Go-Stop leaderboard, and occasionally has massive games
where he receives 300-400 points.

## Sangmok Kim

An adamant believer in "the sequence", Sangmok Kim is an old man who can never
seem to go above -200 points. He wins a considerable number of rounds, but never
earns much from them.

## Tei Kim

A very feisty boi, Tei Kim is usually seen in his natural state of screaming
either at pure joy or in utter panic. He tries to be very vigilant of Juni's
facial expressions and engages in a rather lopsided competition against his
brother in points.
