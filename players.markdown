# The Players

## Juni Kim

Juni Kim always attempts to hide the amount of pi or gwang that he possesses in
a futile bid to force Sangmok or Tei to call "go". He grins when he has a
poktan, and his antics are frequently protested against by Tei Kim.

## Sangmok Kim

An adamant believer in "the sequence", Sangmok Kim can never seem to go above
-200 points. He wins a considerable number of rounds, but never earns much from
them.

## Tei Kim

A chaotic spirit, Tei Kim is usually seen screaming either at pure joy or in
utter panic. He tries to be very vigilant of Juni's facial expressions and
competes with him in points.
