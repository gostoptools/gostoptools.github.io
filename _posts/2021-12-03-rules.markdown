Most of the standard rules of go-stop are followed. Variations are specified below.

# Tti-bak

A player gets a tti-bak if they do not have ribbons, and their payment is
doubled. This only occurs if the winner made points with ribbons.

# Jokers

There are three jokers in the game.

- 2 represent double-pi
- 1 is a gwang

In the event that a person has 6 gwang (including the joker), they receive 30 points from gwang

# First ppeok

If a player commits ppeok (matches a card but they flip over a card of the same
month) on their first turn, they will receive 1 point from all other players.

# Golden Pig

The player who receives the pig (meong) of July will receive one point from all
other players.
