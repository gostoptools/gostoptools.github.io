Today's hwatu game was relatively peaceful without any massive rounds. However,
there were a couple of notable highlights:

- Tei Kim killed off Sangmok's chances at an overwhelming gwang round via a
  cho-dan out of nowhere.

- In one round, Sangmok created a ppeok, ate a ppeok,
  and made a July poktan.
