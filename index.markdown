Go-Stop is a 3-person semi-stochastic fishing game that involves matching cards
of the same month together. The three men of the Kim family frequently play this
game as a relief from their chaotic lives.

As their strategies have evolved, they have implemented a variety of new rules
that they use in their own games in order to prevent certain tricks from being
used.

# Apps

As one of the participants, Juni Kim, is obsessed with web development, the Kim
family uses several custom apps for recording and keeping score of their games.
